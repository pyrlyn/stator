# T42. Closing report

Lexer, parser and text-edit emitter cover TypeScript and TSX. The parser follows tsc's list recovery (variable lists, arrow bodies, `export` lookahead, misspelled keywords, stray tokens), which is what the TS7 parser conformance tests exercise.

Commit: none. The project has no git repository of its own and the workspace ignores `apps/`.

Checked: `stator-ts scan -p src/tsconfig.json` on VS Code (commit c198526d8e64ba6f9944e9f7bcc079ed1f6d7fcc) reads 3,995,410 lines with 0 syntax errors, and the check of that project reports no `TS1xxx` code. Emitted code runs through `stator-ts test` on Node and Bun.

Not covered: emit is not compared with TS7's `.js` baselines, and the parser's error reporting on invalid code is still behind tsc (see `plan/README.md`).
