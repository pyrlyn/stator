# T50. Closing report

No data race found. The audit caught one low-severity real issue: `foo.ts` and `foo.tsx` both map to `foo.js`, where tsc reports TS5056 (recorded in `ideas.md`).

Commit: none, the project has no git repository of its own.

Checked: ThreadSanitizer on aarch64-linux-gnu ReleaseSafe in Lima, 0 reports; a planted race was caught as a positive control. Not run on the whole of weft or on VS Code, and `std.process.run` concurrency in the test runner was not exercised.
